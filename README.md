Log Analysis Tool â€“ Python
A simple Python-based tool to parse and analyze log files for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts.
Built as a hands-on cybersecurity project to practice threat detection techniques and enhance my Python scripting skills.



Why I Built This
Log analysis is a critical skill for any cybersecurity professional.
This project helps simulate real-world threat detection by analyzing logs and identifying patterns that could indicate malicious activity.

Features
Parse plain-text log files (e.g., web server logs, system logs)
Detect repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address
Flag suspicious activity for further investigation
Run on Kali Linux or any Python-supported environment

Skills & Tools Used
Python 3
Regular Expressions (Regex)
File Handling in Python
Basic Threat Detection
Kali Linux

Future Improvements
Support for multiple log file formats
Export suspicious activity to a CSV file
Add timestamp filtering
